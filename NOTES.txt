* TO DO: In README, briefly describe computing environment(s) where
  code has been tested. (i.e., summarize the sessionInfo at the bottom
  of the webpages.)

* TO DO: Add reference in README to manuscript when you have made it
  available (e.g., on arXiv).

* TO DO: In the "license" R Markdown file, add any additional license
  or distribution info about the data.

* TO DO: Remove dates from all your R Markdown files; this is already
  generated automatically when you run wflow_build or wflow_publish.

* TO DO: Fill out the setup instructions in setup.Rmd, and use this to
  generate setup.html. These step-by-step nstructions should include:
  (1) what software that needs to be installed, and where to get it;
  (2) what R packages to install; (3) how to get the data; (4) how to
  generate any preprocessed data or summary statistics from the data,
  and how to generate any other outputs that are necessary to run the
  analyses in the R Markdown documents; and (5) how to generate the
  webpages from the R Markdown documents.

* TO DO: Make sure that all the webpages have the updated navigation
  bar ("home", "setup", "license").
  
* TO DO: Remove any .Rmd and .html files that are no longer used in
  your project. (Remember, they can always be recovered from your git
  history.)
